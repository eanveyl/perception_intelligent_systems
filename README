PERCEPTION AND DECISION MAKING 
FINAL PROJECT


WORKING
---------------------------------------
1. Point cloud matching can be done with ground truth data. 
For this, the translation and rotation matrices are calculated
directly from the ground truth data. 

IN-PROGRESS
---------------------------------------
	

TO RESEARCH FOR POSSIBLITY
---------------------------------------
1. how to recognize planar sections and simplify them to flat sections
	how easy is this?
	what about runtime? if it is too computationally intensive, 
	the advantage is negated
2. check if there is a possibility to implement skeleton map easily


TODO
---------------------------------------
1. check if the point cloud matching can be done without the preprocess_point_cloud step, 
which takes a lot of time.
