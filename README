PERCEPTION AND DECISION MAKING 
FINAL PROJECT


WORKING
---------------------------------------
1. Point cloud matching can be done with ground truth data. 
For this, the translation and rotation matrices are calculated
directly from the ground truth data. 

IN-PROGRESS
---------------------------------------
	

TO RESEARCH FOR POSSIBLITY
---------------------------------------
1. how to recognize planar sections and simplify them to flat sections
	how easy is this?
	what about runtime? if it is too computationally intensive, 
	the advantage is negated
2. check if there is a possibility to implement skeleton map easily
	-> doesn't seem to be that easy
	-> idea would be to match the relative coordinates (already available from the 0,0,0 coordinate 
	available on each time step) to the world coordinates.
	-> then process two separate streams of information, check if the two series of world coordinates come 
	within a radius from one another.
	-> if they do, consider that they could "share" world coordinates at that moment.
		-> in this moment, they share the ground truth coordinates and heading data.
		-> simultaneously, the point cloud from start to that point in time is shared. 


TODO
---------------------------------------
1. check if the point cloud matching can be done without the preprocess_point_cloud step, 
which takes a lot of time.
